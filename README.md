# Junel Balbin: Portfolio

<img src="./assets/images/banner.png">

## Description:
* I was not completely prepared to create a professional portfolio yet, so I decided to build my own mockup portfolio instead.  This would give me a chance to practice my new skills I had recently learned in order to build something better in the future.  It was also a perfect opportunity to explore my creativity and right away I knew I wanted to give it an 80's/90's Anime theme and use it to tell a story.

## Credits & Resources:
* No Portfolio code template was used in this assignment.  Everything was done by trial and error with hours on end.

* Idea snippets and notes from EdX and UCB.

* A very big Thank You to both Juan Carlos Pleitez & Steven Roberts for the inspiration and sharing their wonderful ideas with the flying bird animation. I was able to learn from their code, use their code and made some changes for it to work on my portfolio.  It was difficult to understand what everything was happening but I am slowly learning and figuring it all out.
